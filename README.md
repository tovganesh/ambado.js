An experimental, lightweight and fast web app framework

The project is at a very early stage, but there is a working example in the tests directory.

The project uses basket.js (http://addyosmani.github.io/basket.js/) to aggresively cache resources, to improve load times of Webapps. 
Further, a simple JSON style API allows to quiclky build simple applications.

To try out the sample in tests directory, you need to use NodeJs (and express):
   <pre>node tstnode.js 3000</pre>
And visit your browser at: <pre>http://localhost:3000/</pre>
